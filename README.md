#### *Note: this is a work in progress.*

### What is this?
This repository will contain a dataset of the album's critic, user ratings and metadata from three different music aggregators: Album of the Year (AOTY), Metacritic and Rate Your Music (RYM).

The scrapper script will eventually be made available for those who want to update the existing dataset.

### What kind of data it contains?
It contains 15 features with a total of 100.000 rows of data:
1. Album artist
2. Album title
3. Release date
4. Album format
5. Record label
6. Genre
7. Critic reviews agregated scores
8. User reviews agregated scores

### What can I do with this dataset?
This dataset can be used for EDA or to make album ratings predictions.

### How long did this scrapping project take?
This is an ongoing project. It's expected to be concluded within four weeks. The starter date is October 7 2020.
